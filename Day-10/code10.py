# Regular Expressions in Python
'''
Regular expressions (regex) in Python let you search, match, or manipulate text patterns using the re module â€” useful for tasks like validating emails, extracting numbers, or replacing words.

Use python documentation for complete guide on regular documentation.
For Meta characters in 're' module refer to IBM documentation.
'''
# This is an built in module.
import re



# Async IO in python
'''
1. It is a built-in module in Python.
2. The asyncio module lets you write asynchronous code that runs tasks concurrently using async/await, ideal for I/O-bound operations like APIs or file handling.

# Multi-threading in Python
'''
1. We use it using buit-in module called threading.
2. The threading module enables concurrent execution of code using multiple threads, best for speeding up CPU-light, I/O-heavy tasks
'''

'''
Inko basically tb use krna chaiye when function codes takes long time to execute like for example we have to download 10 files of size 1GB each...If we do it one-by-one it will take so much time but when we use multi-threading we can start downloading all 10 files parallely and out net speed gets used completely and speed of our program increases...also further code can get executed till the files will get downloaded.

# Using concurrent.futures module in python

'''NOTE: Here, Using this module It will undergo it's processes first and the further code does not get executed until the process is completed, so it is not like threading module concept.'''
